The Programming Formalisms example project.

## Goal

N-body simulation, e.g. galaxy sim or predator-prey

## Design document

### Client Project Brief

The program should visually display a number of particles on a field. Particles are initialised with a certain position and speed. Each particle interacts with all the other particles in a simple way, e.g. gravitational attraction, Lennard-Jones potential, direction alignment (implementing a flocking behaviour), or something else, the group chooses which. Decide on a boundary condition (e.g. bounce or wrap or eliminate the particle). The simulation is then stepped forward, drawing each step, until stopped. The goal is to create a stable simulation capable of the maximum number of particles at an acceptable framerate.
