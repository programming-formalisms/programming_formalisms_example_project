The Programming Formalisms example project.

## Goal

N-body simulation, e.g. galaxy sim or predator-prey

## Usage

The simulation can be started in two ways:

 * Console application: a text-only version
 * GUI application: using graphical windows

### Console application

#### From the command line

In the project root, from a terminal, do:

```
./scripts/run_console.sh
```

Or, which are the equivalent two steps:

```
# Install the package from the local code
python3 -m pip install .

# Run the code
python3 main.py
```
