When gathering requirements for the program the first iteration is based on analyzing the project breif for subjects and actions, i.e nouns and verbs that will describe the possible demands the users have on the system, after the first pass pay attention to adjective and adverbials that may change a need or requirement. After this make a Table of requirements, from this a system use case design can begin. After the use cases have been determined go through each use case and see how an object or action can solve this use case. Design a object/class diagram to reflect this possibly through a collaborations diagram.
