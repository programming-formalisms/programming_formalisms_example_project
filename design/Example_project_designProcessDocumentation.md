# Design Process Documentation

<em> The design process documentation serves to describe how the process of designing the software has been done</em>

During this project two examples of the design process will be described A traditional approach and a AI-assisted approach, the AI assisted approach greatly improves initial phase and can help with some of the refinement but as with all AI-assisted work, It is imperative to check the resulting parts both for completeness and correctness just as if you are doing it you do an un assisted process.  There will be two DPD(Design Process Document)s inside this project one is the unassisted DPD_unassisted.md and one assisted DPD_assisted.md During this project all files pertaining that are AI assisted will have the prefix DPAI_ and all that uses no ai assistance will have the prefix DPAI_ this goes for folders as well as for files
