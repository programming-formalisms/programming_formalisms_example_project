# DPD Unassisted

When gathering requirements for the program 
the first iteration is based on analyzing 
the project brief for subjects and actions, 
i.e nouns and verbs that will describe the possible 
demands the users have on the system, 
after the first pass pay attention to adjective and adverbials 
that may change a need or requirement. 

After this make a Table of requirements, 
from this a system use case design can begin. 
After the use cases have been determined, 
go through each use case 
and see how an object or action can solve this use case. 

Design a object/class diagram to reflect this possibly 
through a collaborations diagram.
